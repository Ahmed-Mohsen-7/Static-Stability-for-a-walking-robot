# Static-Stability-for-a-walking-robot
This project discusses and implements static stability for a 4 legged robot. For simplicity, the robot is modeled as a point mass with four reactions forces (one reaction force from each leg). Under the gravitational force, the static stability is checked using  cvxpy library. There are four different scenarios for the robot. This repo contains code implementation and the report for this project.
